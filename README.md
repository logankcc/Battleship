# Battleship

This repository contains all source code and resources for a C++ version of the classic board game Battleship. The game was created by Logan Copeland, Reid Moffat, Maya Steckly, Jacob Wong, Barry Wei, and Shirley Hu for a C++ software development course at Queen's University. Individual contributions are listed in the header of each file. All art was created by Logan Copeland.

The SFML graphics library was used to create the GUI as well as the game engine. SFML library functions were leveraged to manage event handling and texture rendering. This provided the flexibility for the team to build the game engine from the ground up. The game comes with both singleplayer and multiplayer modes. Singleplayer allows for the user to choose between two difficulty options. Multiplayer allows for two users to play locally against one another. An instructions page is also available for users that are new to the game. The final product is shown briefly in the videos listed below.
